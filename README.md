# CommsBot

It's basically a sound pad for gamers. Use your numpad when you don't want to use your voice for voice chat.

**What Is this?**
- You know how you basically don't use your numpad? Many people don't even have a numpad. Well fortunately, you have one(hopefully). Instead of getting a 60% keyboard (or a smaller laptop), you can use this!
- This soundpad uses your filesystem to determine what sounds will be played. Yes, this is basically a file browser. No, this is not a calculator.
- You can nest sounds in up to 9 folders per layer (Number 1-9). And an infinite amount of layers (possible but might crash  the universe).
- Sound is played on what ever device you want. You can play the audio on up to two devices. Pass it through a Voiceemeter input and use that output in your games as a mic!

**Other things you need**
1. Make sure you have .NET Framework 4.8 installed on your system. Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) to download it from  the official Microsoft Website.

## Note 

- These program is very much in development. It only runs on Windows, and is in beta (right now). However, I am confident with my current progress and that it will run in most computers. That is why you can  download it here!
- The soundpad only plays Wave (.wav) audio files. Other formats will be supported in the future.

**Downloads**

- Latest Release is found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/NoThrottle/CommsBot/releases).
- This is the only website where I officially release updates and downloads. Since the code is open for anyone to use, there may be more versions of this made by other people. Their versions are fine but make sure you are not downloading malware.
